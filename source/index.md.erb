## Overview

Scout Application Monitoring is a lightweight, production-grade application monitoring service built for modern development teams. Just embed our agent in your application: we handle the data collection. 

Here's an overview of the key functionality in our application monitoring service:

### The Agent

We currently monitor Ruby on Rails apps. Support for other languages and frameworks is under development. 

Our agent is designed to run in production environments and has low overhead. We've benchmarked the response time overhead at roughly 3%. Every minute, the agent transmits metrics to our service over SSL. 

There's nothing to install on your servers: just include our Ruby Gem within your Rails app. You'll quickly see actionable metrics from the [common libaries we instrument](#instrumented-libaries).

### User Interface

A complete overview of the Scout UX is available in the [features](#features) area of this help site.
