<h2 id="how-we-collect-metrics">How we collect metrics</h2>

<p>Scout is engineered to monitor the performance of your mission-critical production applications by providing an easy-install, low-overhead monitoring agent with a hosted SaaS service that values your security. The basic flow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Embed our agent in your application. You don&rsquo;t access to the servers your app is deployed on.</li>
<li>The agent instruments key libaries (database access, controllers, views, etc) using low-overhead instrumentation. </li>
<li>Every minute, the agent connects over https (always) through a 256-bit secure, encrypted connection (the same encryption your bank uses) and sends metrics to our servers.</li>
<li>Over servers store the data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="performance-overhead">Performance Overhead</h2>

<p>Our agent is designed to run in production environments. We&rsquo;ve benchmarked the response time overhead at roughly 3%. Generally, overhead increases as the number of methods are instrumented.</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>We take the security of your code metrics extremely seriously. Keeping your data secure is fundamental to our business. Scout is nearing a decade storing critical metrics with our server monitoring product and those same fundamentals are applied here:</p>

<ul>
<li>All data transmitted by our agent to our servers is sent via SSL.</li>
<li>Our UI is only served under SSL.</li>
<li>When additional data is collected for slow calls (ex: SQL queries), query parameters are sanitized before sending these to our servers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="git-integration">Git Integration</h3>

<p>Scout only needs read-only access to your repository, but unfortunately, Github doesn&rsquo;t currently allow this - they only offer read-write permissions through their OAuth API.</p>

<p>We have asked Github to offer read-only permissions, and they&rsquo;ve said that the feature coming soon. In the mean time, we&rsquo;re limited to the permissions structure Github offers. Our current Git security practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>we don&rsquo;t clone your repository&rsquo;s code; we only pull the commit history</li>
<li>the commit history is secured on our servers according to industry best practices</li>
<li>authentication subsystems within our application ensure your commit history is never exposed to anyone outside your account.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that said, we suggest the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/contact">Contact Github</a> about allowing read-only access. This will ensure it stays top-of-mind.</li>
<li>This is optional and you are able to view backtrace information w/o the integration. It&rsquo;s likely possible to even write a UserScript to open the code locally in your editor or on Github.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="billing">Billing</h2>

<p>You can choose the billing approach that makes sense for your organization. We offer two billing options:</p>

<h3 id="per-server">Per-Server</h3>

<p><strong>This is the default approach</strong>. You are billed for the number of servers that are actively reporting on your billing date. </p>

<h3 id="per-request">Per-Request</h3>

<p>If you have a smaller application or have many smaller instances or Docker containers per-request billing may make more sense. Volume discounts are automatically applied as your application handles more throughput. </p>

<h3 id="changing-your-billing-option">Changing your Billing Option</h3>

<p>You can pick your billing approach in the billing area within Scout. Your billing preference can not be retroactively applied.</p>

<h2 id="replacing-new-relic">Replacing New Relic</h2>

<p>Scout is an attractive option for modern dev teams (frequent deploys, using Git, deploying to many micro instances &amp; containers, using vendors for key infastructure services like Amazon RDS, etc). We provide a laser-focus on getting to slow custom application code fast vs. wide breadth as debugging slow custom application code is typically the most time-intensive performance optimization work. </p>

<p>In many cases, Scout is able to replace New Relic as-is. However, there are cases where your app has specific needs we currently don&rsquo;t provide. Here&rsquo;s some of the more common scenarios and our suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exception Monitoring</strong> - we provide metrics on the rate of exceptions but we don&rsquo;t currently provide details on exceptions. Our favorite tool for this is <a href="http://getsentry.com">Sentry</a>:

<ul>
<li>Affordable: starts @ $29/mo. </li>
<li>Realtime exceptions: you&rsquo;ll see new exceptions coming through as-they-happen (every second). </li>
<li>Great UI</li>
<li>Context tracking (easy to see how an exception is impacting which users). We implemented a similar API for our slow request tracking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Alerting</strong> - while on our roadmap, we don&rsquo;t yet provide alerting within application monitoring. However, <a href="https://scoutapp.com/info/server_monitoring">Scout Server Monitoring</a> has robust alerting functionality. With the <a href="https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_statsd_rack">Scout StatsD Rack Gem</a> you can easily get alerted on jumps in error rates and response times.</li>
<li><strong>Background Job Monitoring</strong> - this is on our roadmap as well. <a href="https://scoutapp.com/info/server_monitoring">Scout Server Monitoring</a> can be used to monitor queue depths, failure rates, etc for all of the common Ruby background job systems. Many background job systems also provide a web ui (for example, the <a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Monitoring#web-ui">Sidekiq Web UI</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Browser Monitoring (Real User Monitoring)</strong> - there are a number of dedicated tools for both Real User Monitoring (RUM) and synthetic monitoring. You can also continue to use New Relic for browser monitoring and use Scout for application monitoring.</li>
</ul>
