<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Scout is engineered to monitor the performance of your mission-critical production applications by providing a low-overhead monitoring agent and service that values your security.</p>

<h2 id="performance-overhead">Performance Overhead</h2>

<p>Our agent is designed to run in production environments. We&rsquo;ve benchmarked the response time overhead at roughly 3%. Generally, overhead increases as the number of methods are instrumented.</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>We take the security of your code metrics extremely seriously. Keeping your data secure is fundamental to our business. Scout is nearing a decade storing critical metrics with our server monitoring product and those same fundamentals are applied here:</p>

<ul>
<li>All data transmitted by our agent to our servers is sent via SSL.</li>
<li>Our UI is only served under SSL.</li>
<li>When additional data is collected for slow calls (ex: SQL queries), query parameters are sanitized before sending these to our servers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="git-integration">Git Integration</h3>

<p>Scout only needs read-only access to your repository, but unfortunately, Github doesn&rsquo;t currently allow this - they only offer read-write permissions through their OAuth API.</p>

<p>We have asked Github to offer read-only permissions, and they&rsquo;ve said that the feature coming soon. In the mean time, we&rsquo;re limited to the permissions structure Github offers. Our current Git security practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>we don&rsquo;t clone your repository&rsquo;s code; we only pull the commit history</li>
<li>the commit history is secured on our servers according to industry best practices</li>
<li>authentication subsystems within our application ensure your commit history is never exposed to anyone outside your account.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that said, we suggest the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/contact">Contact Github</a> about allowing read-only access. This will ensure it stays top-of-mind.</li>
<li>This is optional and you are able to view backtrace information w/o the integration. It&rsquo;s likely possible to even write a UserScript to open the code locally in your editor or on Github.</li>
</ul>
